1.Write a program to read a character from the keyboard and display at the beginning of the next line. Page: 69(Done)

2.Write a program to (a) display a “?” (b) read two decimal digits whose sum less than 10 (c) display them and their sum on the next line. Page: 80 

3.Write a program to (a) prompt the user, (b) read first, middle, and last initials of a person’s name, and display them down the left margin. Page: 80

4.Write a program to display a message.  Page: 75(Done)

5.Write a program to enter a lower case letter and on the next line display another message with the letter in uppercase. Page: 76(Done)

6.Write a program to enter a uppercase/lowercase letters and display in lowercase/uppercase letter.

7.Suppose AX and BX contain signed numbers. Write a program to put the biggest one in CX and also display it. Page: 97

8.If AL contains 1 or 3, display ‘O’. If Al contains 2 or 4 display ‘E’. Write a program to solve it. Page: 105

9.Write a program to count the number of characters in an input line. Page: 105

10.Write a program to prompt the user to enter a line of text. On the next line display the capital letter that come first alphabetically and the one that comes last. If no capital letters
are entered display “No Capital Letter”. Page: 108 

11.Write a program to put the sum 1+4+7+...............+148 in AX. Then display the result. Page: 114 

12.Write a program to put the sum 100+95+90+..........+5  in AX. Then display the result. Page: 114 

13.Write a program to display a ‘?’ and also read two capital letters and display them next line alphabetically order. Page: 115


14.Write a program to display extended ASCII characters (ASCII code 80h to FFh). Display 10 characters per line separated by blanks. Stop the program after extended characters have been displayed. Page: 114




15.Write a program that will prompt the user to enter a hex digit character (0...9 or A...F)
. Display it on the next line in decimal and the user if he or she wants to do it. Again if the user type ‘y’ or ‘Y’ the program repeats. If the user type anything else the program terminates. If the user types an illegal character, prompt the user to type again. Page: 115

16. Write a program to reverse a bit pattern. Page: 130

17.Write a program to read a binary input from the keyboard and display it. Page: 130

18.Write a program to read a hex input and display it in binary. Page: 133

19.Write a program that prompts the user to enter a character and on subsequence line print its ASCII code in binary and the number of 1 bit in its ASCII code. Page: 136

20. Write a program that prompts the user to enter two binary numbers up to 8 digits each and print their sum the next line in binary. If the user enters an illegal character he or she should be prompted to begin again. Each input end with a carriage return.

21. Write a program that prompts the user to enter two unsigned numbers 0 to FFFFh and their sum in hex on the next line.

22.Write a program to read a sequence of characters and display them in reverse order on the next line. Page: 144

23. Write a program for finding product of two positive integers A and B by addition and bit shifting.
